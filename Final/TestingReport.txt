Nick Lindbloom-Airey:

I do not like the choppy movement of the spaceship when you press the up and down keys. 
If you could make this much smoother I would enjoy the game more. Also, you should 
decrease the number of stars in the background because it is very distracting to have 
2000 stars that make the screen look funny. You should also improve the shooting 
mechanic. It only shoots sometimes unless you hold down the spacebar. 

Response:

I agree with all the things Nick said. I will make a boolean to move the ship up and
 down in the animate class so the movement is not choppy. I will also decrease the 
 number of stars in the background from 2000 to 1000 so that the background will 
 be less distracting. I have also fixed the shooting mechanic to shoot as soon as 
 the spacebar is pressed, so that there is no delay. 

My Mother: 

The rectangles for enemies are cool, but I think you should use pictures instead
 of rectangles to make the game look better. Also, the backgrounds look very 
 similar and I think you should change the colors. Finally, if you made the game
 have a theme instead of random objects.

Response:

I have replaced the enemies, ship, and boss level with PNG images that are much
 more interesting than rectangles. I have also created a theme for the game with
 these images. The theme for the game is now monkeys trying to get a banana. 
 The monkeys are the enemies and the banana is the spaceship. This will make the
 game look much more interesting and fun to play.
